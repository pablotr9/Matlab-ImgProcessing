# Matlab-ImgProcessing

User interface in Matlab (using GUI) allowing the user to load an image and visualize it.
The interface allows the user to convert it in grayscale, negative or enhance it 
using the piecewise linear contrast streching technique where the user defines the two points.
Constrast stretching is used to increase the dynamic range of the gray levels for low-contrast images due to:
poor illumination, lack of dynamic range in the imaging sensor or wrong setting of a lens aperture during image acquisition.
